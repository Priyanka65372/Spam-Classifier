# Spam-Classifier
This project focuses on building a robust spam classifier using machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest and Logistic Regression models.
The dataset used for training and testing is generated from Apache SpamAssassinâ€™s public datasets, ensuring a diverse and representative collection of spam and non-spam (ham) emails.
The email files obtained undergoes thorough a transformation to a dataset, the text data then undergoes preprocessing, and the Count Vectorizer technique is employed to convert textual information into numerical features, making it suitable for model training.
An accuracy of 98.73% is achieved through Random forest model and an acurracy of 98.81% is achieved via Logistic Regression.
